# Automated-SQL-Query-Generation-and-Visualization-Using-LLMs
The "Data Query and Visualization using LLM" project aims to create an intelligent interface for querying a MySQL database using natural language. The primary objective is to simplify data retrieval for users by leveraging OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to translate natural language queries into SQL. The project overview includes database creation, SQL query generation using LLM, data visualization with Streamlit, and thorough documentation.

The objective is to create a system that enables users to query a database using natural language and visualize the results. We chose football and company-related databases for this project. Its significance lies in helping users query data easily in simple English rather than SQL, making it accessible for anyone to use.
